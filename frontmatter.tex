The Standard Model has been a successful theory in describing the behaviour of fundamental particles, but there are still problems remaining unsolved. New theoretical models are therefore proposed to answer those questions with either new interactions or new particles. This thesis is presenting the searches for new physics with dibosn signatures in the two forms from LHC $\sqrt{s}=13~TeV$ collisions with the ATLAS detector. The data was collected in 2015 and 2016 corresponding to the integrated luminosity of $36.1~fb^{-1}$
\\
\\And, both the LHC and ATLAS detector are now going through the upgrades for the operation in 2021 with the $\sqrt{s}=14TeV$ collisions. This thesis will also show the ongoing upgrade work for the hardware calorimeter trigger in the simulation and study in the proposed algorithms for object reconstruction.

The three and half years of PhD has been a wonderful adventure, and here is to present my appreciation for the people who are part of my journey.
\\
\\Firstly, I want to thank my supervisor, Christopher Lester. The whole work of my PhD will not be possible without his support and help. And, I also want to show my gratitude to my college, Peterhouse. It has funded my PhD and enrich my life outside of research.
