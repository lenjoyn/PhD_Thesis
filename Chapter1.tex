\chapter{Introduction and Motivation}
Particle physics is the subject to study the fundamental structure of the universe. It is now based on the theory called "Standard Model" (SM). It interprets the universe as the composition of tiny particles interacting with each other by the exchange of force carriers (another type of particles).  In July 2012, the discovery of Higgs boson made by the ATLAS and CMS collaboration completed SM 50 years after it was predicted. By now, it has been deemed as one of the most successful theories in modern physics by delivery promising expectation toward experimental measurement. 
\\
\\
However, there are still some conflicts between SM and the factual results. For example, in SM, neutrinos are supposed to be massless, but the discovery of neutrino oscillation support the fact that neutrinos are massive, and SM cannot explain it. New theories are proposed in order to resolve those conflicts, and they indicate the existence of some new particles or the deviation from SM predictions. This thesis is dedicated to the work in search for this kind of new physics.  
\section{Standard Model}
The basic concept of SM is from quantum field theory(QFT): the universe is filled with different fields, and all fundamental particles (particles without further substructure) are the forms of quantized fields. They make up the matters and also mediate interactions between them, which is the foundation how this universe operates. Those fundamental particles could be classified into two types: fermions and bosons. Fermions are the matter builder, while bosons are the force carriers exchanged between particles (for both fermions and bosons). 
\\
\\{\bf Fermions}
\\
\\Fermions are quantized from fermionic field following Dirac-Fermi statistics with half integer spin number, $\pm\frac{1}{2}$. Under the statistic characteristic, fermions exclude each other with the same quantum status, which makes them distinguished from bosons. \\
\\
All fermions have their counter antiparticles which in SM have opposite charge and chirality. Those fermions are called "Driac Fermions". They can be presented as Weyl spinors of four components composed of one left-handed spinor and one right handed spinor following Dirac equation. However, neutrinos, a sub-specie of fermions, have no anti-particle found\footnote{Due to being neutral, anti-neutrinos would only be different in chirality, but only left-handed neutrinos were measured.}, so they are assumed to be "Majorana Fermions": they are their own antiparticle. They could be instead presented as Majorana spinors in Majorana equation. 
\\
\\{\bf Dirac Equation}: $(\beta mc^2+c\overrightarrow{\alpha}\hat{p})\psi(x,t)=i\hbar\frac{\partial{\psi(x,t)}}{\partial{t}}$
\\
\\{\bf Majorana Equation}:$-i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi+m\psi_c=0$
\\
\\$ \hat{\alpha}= \left( \begin{array}{l  r}  0& \sigma_i  \\  \sigma_i&0   \end{array}\right) $ with $\sigma_i$ as Pauli matrix and $\beta=\left( \begin{array}{l r} \hat{I}&0 \\ 0 & \hat{I}\end{array}\right)$.  $\psi$ is the fermion field with charge conjugate $\psi_c$, $\gamma^\mu$ is the gamma matrix and m is the particle mass.
\\ 
\\Fermions can then be further categorized into two types, quarks and leptons, by the interactions they participate in. Quarks are the only particles involved in the strong interaction. Due to this reason, they cannot exist alone, and, instead, they are always in bound state as mesons of two quarks or baryons of three quarks. If they are in free state, they emit gluons (strong interaction force carrier) which  decay into other quakrs, and all the quarks would form the bound state. 
\\
\\Quarks have 3 generations (flavours) and 6 types. In each generation are quarks with different charges: $\frac{-1}{3}$ and $\frac{2}{3}$. The first generation are the lightest one: up and down. Strange and charm are in the second generation. The third generation has bottom and top with highest mass. Quarks can change their flavour through CKM matrix with weak interaction. The decay relation between quarks is shown in Fig.\ref{Fig:quarks}
\\    
\begin{figure}[!h]

		\caption{Relation between quarks are determined by CKM matrix.}
		\label{Fig:quarks}            
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Similar to quarks, leptons also have 3 generations and 6 types. In each generation, there is one neutral neutrino and their corresponding charged particle with charge -1. The three generations are electrons, muons and taus with their neutrino partners (among them, electron neutrino is assumed to be the lightest fundamental particle under normal hierarchy). Leptons participate in weak interaction, electromagnetism(except for neutral neutrinos) and gravity. They can change flavours through PMNS matrix with weak interaction.
\\
\\{\bf Interaction and Bosons}
\\
\\Under SM, the interactions between particles are induced by gauge fields which could be quantized into gauge bosons. Different from fermions, those bosons follow Bose-Einstein statistics with integer spin number, which means they are allowed to stay in the same quantum state. They mediate interactions between particles including themselves under symmetries for relative invariance. 
\\
\\Although there are four fundamental forces in the universe, only three of them are in SM, because they are quantizable: electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. The challenge of quantizing gravity is still not overtaken in modern physics. Each interaction has their part in the SM Lagrange formulism.
\\
\\Electromagnetic interaction is the best known among the 4 interactions. It is explained by quantum electrodynamic in SM. The interaction is induced by electromagnetic field between two charged particles with charge as the invariance under $U(1)$ symmetry, which could be seen as they interchange photons. Because electromagnetic interaction only occurs within charged particles, photon doesn't interact with neutral particles. The coupling constant (interaction strength which determines the possibility of a process  occurs) in the interaction is:
\\
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\hbar c}=\frac{1}{137.036...}
\end{equation}
\\
with $e$ as electric charge of electron, $\hbar$ as reduced Plank constant and $c$, the speed of light. Its part in SM could be written as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu})\psi-F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}
   \label{Eq:EM Lagrange}  
\end{equation}
In this equation, $\gamma^\mu$ is the Gamma matrices, $\psi$ is the Weyl spinor of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles and $\bar{\psi}$ is the Dirac adjoint of $\psi$. $D_\mu=\partial_\mu+ieA_\mu+ieB_\mu$ represents the gauge covariant derivative with $e$ as the electric charge, $A_\mu$ as the filed induced by the particle itself and $B_\mu$ as the field from external source. In the equation, $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the electromagnetic field tensor. 
\\
\\All the left-handed particles participate in weak interaction. It is mediated by three different bosons: $W^+$, $W^-$ and $Z^0$ boson. They are massive gauge bosons which obtain mass via electroweak symmetry breaking. W bosons is the mediator when a particle changes its flavour along with charge, while Z boson is involved in neutral current interaction leaving the particles unchanged with only kinematic momentum transfer. Within this process, an arbitrary and unmeasurable quantity, isospin, is conserved under $SU_L(2)$ symmetry. Its definition is similar to the spin numbers of a pair of electrons in the same orbital. For two fermions in the same generations, their quantum states are identical except for isospin which is opposite of them to each other. As right-handed fermions don't participate in weak interaction, their isospin is 0. The isospins of fermions are showed in Table.\ref{Tab:isospin}.

    \label{Tab:isospin}
\end{table}
The coupling constant for weak interaction is pretty weak, and it is between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-7}$ with short distance of $10^{-16}$m.
A unification between weak and electromagnetic interaction could be achieved with a new arbitrary parameter called electroweak hypercharge defined as $Y_w=2 (Q-I_3)$ where $I_3$ is isospin and $Q$ is the electric charge under $SU_L(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry.  In SM, the symmetry would be spontaneously broken by the Higgs field to give particles mass. It will be discussed in next section.
\\
\\Only quarks are involved in strong interaction which was described by quantum chromodynamics(QCD). The conserved quantity in the interaction is also an imaginary one, colour, with gluons as the force carrier boson under $SU(3)$ symmetry. There are 3 different colours: red, blue and green along with their anti-colour partner. Similar to the principle of light, the colour would be 0 when the three colours are mixed together or with their anti-colour, and it is the condition for a stable state in QCD. Each quark is only allowed to carry one colour, but the state is unstable. It needs to be bound with another quarks to stabilize the system, and they exchange gluons to form the bounding force. In QCD, gluons have 8 types with different colour combinations:
\begin{equation}
         (r\bar{b}+b\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}, \quad -i(r\bar{b}-b\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}  \\
         (r\bar{g}+g\bar{r})/\sqrt{2}, \quad -i(r\bar{g}-g\bar{r}/\sqrt{2})  \\
          (b\bar{g}+g\bar{b})/\sqrt{2},\quad -i(b\bar{g}-g\bar{b}/\sqrt{2})   \\
          (r\bar{r}-b\bar{b})/\sqrt{2},\quad  r\bar{r}+b\bar{b}=2g\bar{g}/\sqrt{6}
\end{equation}
with $r$, red charge, $b$, blue charge, and $g$, green charge.\\
\\
\\Different from the other interactions, the intensity of strong interaction is proportional to the square of distance. This strange behaviour is due to the gluon property. As the distance between two quarks is getting longer, the emitted gluon would decay into more standalone quarks to induce more gluons. The chain effect thus strengthen the interaction coupling. However, due to the constraint of the allowed interaction distance, it would not go to infinity, which could be proved mathematically via "Renormalization".
\\
\\Its presentation in SM Lagrange could be shown as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{QCD}=\bar{\psi}(i(\gamma^\mu D_\mu)_{ij}-m\delta_{ij})\psi_j-\frac{1}{4}G^a_{\mu\nu}G_a^{\mu\nu} 
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
G^a_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu\mathcal{A}^a_\mu-\partial_\nu\mathcal{A}^a_\nu+gf^{abc}\mathcal{A}^b_\mu\mathcal{A}^c_\nu 
\end{equation}
with $\psi_i$, the quark field in $SU(3)$ representation indexed of i,j, ..., $G^a_{\mu\nu}$, the gluon field also in $SU(3)$ representation indexed of a, b... from 1 to 8. $f^{abc}$ is the structure constant, $\mathcal{A}_\mu$ is the spin 1 gluon filed and $g = \sqrt{4\pi\alpha_s}$ is the QCD coupling constant.
\\
\\All the elementary particles with their basic properties are shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:elementary_particle}. The 3 interactions with their conserved quantities makes SM under the gauge theory with the gauge group with $U(1) \times SU(2)_L \times SU(3)$ gauge group.

\section{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}
One particle in Fig. \ref{Fig:elementary_particle} is not mentioned yet: Higgs boson, the last discovered fundamental particle in SM. It 
arises from quantized Higgs field which was proposed by 3 groups in early 1960s:  Robert Brout and Francois Englert, Peter Higgs as well as Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble. It induces spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking via ''Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanis``.  The discovery was announced on 4th July 2012 and confirmed on 14 March 2013 with spin 0 and $+$ parity by the ATLAS and CMS collaboration.
\\
\\Higgs field is defined as the scalar gauge field in a complex scalar $SU(2)_L$ doublet :
\begin{equation}
 \Phi= \left(  \begin{array}{ c } \phi^+\\  \phi^0 \end{array} \right) 
\end{equation}
The potential comes from the field is:
\begin{equation}
 V(\Phi)=\mu^2|\Phi^\dagger\Phi|+\lambda(|\Phi^\dagger\Phi|)^2
\label{Eq:sm_higgs_potential}
\end{equation}
In the common condition, the minimal potential is at $\Phi = 0$, and the shape of the potential would be as Fig. \ref{Fig:V} (this is a simplified plot, and the real one should be in 4 dimensions). In this potential, the symmetry is not broken with the minimal value at $\Phi = 0$.
\\ 
\begin{figure}[!h]                
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Chapter1/V.pdf}
	\centering
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Scalar potential with $\mu^2 > 0$}
		\label{Fig:V}            
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\\In the other scenario for $\mu^2 < 0$, the potential shape becomes Fig. \ref{Fig:higgs}. The minimal expected value of the potential is not at 0 but :
\begin{equation}
\langle\Phi\rangle=\sqrt{-\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda}}\left ( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right) \equiv\frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}}\left ( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
The potential is only affected by $|\Phi^\star\Phi|$, so the shape of the potential is determined by the real term (imaginary terms are cancelled out). This is called "vacuum expectation value"(VEV). To maintain the stable state, particles are only allowed to stay in the lowest potential, the valley part. This makes the degree of freedom of the particles decrease from 4 to 1 and breaks the $SU_L(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry with isospin and hypercharge to $U(1)$ symmetry with electric charge.  
\begin{figure}[!h]                
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Chapter1/higgs.pdf}
	\centering
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Scalar potential with $\mu^2 < 0$}
		\label{Fig:higgs}            
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
In high energy regime above the valley (excited state), electromagnetic and weak interaction are mixed together to form three $SU_L(2)$ gauge bosons, $W^i_\mu$ with $\mu =1,2,3$ and one $U(1)$ gauge boson, $B_\mu$. They are not SM particles, but they could be taken as the excited form of SM gauge bosons. The Lagrange for the interaction between them and Higgs field is:
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{L}=(D^\mu\Phi)^\dagger(D_\mu\Phi) - V(\Phi) 
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
 D_\mu = \partial_\mu+i\frac{g}{2}\tau\cdot W_\mu+i\frac{g'}{2}B_\mu Y
 \label{Eq:electroweak symmetry Lagrange}  
\end{equation}
$g$ and $g'$ are the coupling constants between the fields, $\tau$ is the Pauli matrix and Y is the hypercharge.
\\
\\With the unitary gauge transformation on Higgs field, there will be no Goldstone bosons\footnote{Unitary gauge transformation is to select the fixed gauge which sets the Goldstone boson terms into 0} after the symmetry breaking. The Higgs field is thus shifted with the new gauge as:
\begin{equation}
\Phi=\frac{\nu+h}{\sqrt{2}}\left ( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
with h, the physical Higgs sector, as a complex number.
\\
\\After inserting the new Higgs field into and rearranging SM Lagrange, the SM gauge bosons could be shown as:  
\begin{equation}
W^{\pm}_\mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(W^{1}_\mu\mp iW^{2}_\mu) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Z^\mu=\frac{-g'B_\mu+gW^3_\mu}{\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
A^\mu=\frac{gB_\mu+g'W^3_\mu}{\sqrt{g'^2+g^2}} 
\end{equation}
with particle mass:
\begin{equation}
M^2_W=\frac{1}{4}g^2\nu^2 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M^2_Z =\frac{1}{4}(g^2+g'^2)\nu^2 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M_A=0 
\end{equation}
From the expression, it turns out that $Z$ boson and photon are both the mix of $B$ and $W^3$ bosons with different phases which could be shown as:
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}  A \\ Z \end{array} \right]=\left[ \begin{array}{l r} cos\theta_W &  sin\theta_W \\ -sin\theta_W & cos\theta_W \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}  B\\ W^3 \end{array} \right] 
  \label{Eq:AZ phase}  
\end{equation}
With $\cos{\theta_W}=\frac{g}{\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}}$ and $\sin{\theta_W}=\frac{g'}{\sqrt{g^2+g'^2}}$. Here, $\theta_W$ is called weak mixing angle or Weinberg angle. By this, electroweak $\rho$ parameter is defined:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:rho}
\rho = \frac{m_W}{m_Z\cos{\theta_W}} 
\end{equation}
\\with the comparison between Eq. \ref{Eq:EM Lagrange} and Eq. \ref{Eq:electroweak symmetry Lagrange} with Eq. \ref{Eq:AZ phase}, the electric charge could be defined as:
\begin{equation}
e=g\sin{\theta_W}=g'\cos{\theta_W}
\end{equation}
\\This relation gives the access to precision measurement of $\rho$, which is now given ~1.0008, a litte deviation from expectation of 1 in SM because of the loop diagram correction.
\\
\\In terms of degrees of freedom, before symmetry breaking, its comes with 4 degrees from Higgs complex scalar doublet, 6 degrees from $SU(2)_L$ gauge field, $W_i$, and 2 degrees from $U(1)_Y$ gauge field, $B$, which makes 12 degrees in total for all the massless fields. After symmetry breaking, the number of degrees of freedom doesn't reduce with 9 degrees from 3 massive vector boson, $Z$ and $W_{\pm}$, 2 degrees from massless photon,A, and 1 degree from physical real scalar field, $h$.
\\
\\Not only granting mass to bosons, the interaction between fermions and Higgs boson is also part of the Brout-Englert-Higgs Mechanism. The left-handed fermionic field is defined as a doublet:
\begin{equation}
 Q_L=\left(  \begin{array}{ c } u_L\\  d_L \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
For right-handed leptons, the representation would be in a singlet because of the lack of right-handed neutrinos.      
\\
\\Their interation with Higgs field are through Yukawa coupling\footnote{Yukawa coupling means the coupling betweent fermionic and bosonic fields}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = -\lambda\bar{Q_L}\Phi d_R + h.c. 
\end{equation}
with $\lambda$ as the coupling constant. The Lagrange can lead to the quark mass as:
\begin{equation}
 m_d=\frac{\lambda \nu}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
The Lagrange is indicating that this mechaism would change the chirality of a fermion, when it is giving the mass. However, no right-handed neutrinos were measured, which leaves it as one of the unsolved problem in SM. 
\section{Unsolved Problems in SM}
With SM, we have understood most behaviours of the fundamental particles. However, it still failed explaining some experimental results. The following is part of the them the work in the thesis is trying to answer.
\\
\\{\bf Higgs Mass Naturalness}
\\
\\In quantum field theory, all the experimental observables could be presented as:
\begin{equation}
O=a_1+a_2+a_3+...
\end{equation}
where O is the observables, and $a_n$ are the independent contributions to the observables. For naturalness of the observable, it is expected that $a_n\leq O$. For any case that $a_n>>0$, the further fine-tuning needs to be introduced for proper correction on theory, and it also indicates the defect in the theory. \\
\\The form for the observable of Higgs mass is:
\begin{equation}
m_h^2=2\mu^2+\delta m_h^2
\end{equation}
where $\delta m_h^2$ for the contribution from coupling to top quark is:
\begin{equation}
\delta m_h^2 \simeq \frac{3}{4\pi^2}\left(\lambda^2_t+\frac{g^2}{4}+\frac{g^2}{8\cos^2{\theta_w}}+\lambda\right)\Lambda
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_t$ is the top-quark Yukawa coupling, g is the $SU\left(2\right)$ gauge coupling, $\lambda$ is the the coupling constant in the quadratic term in Higgs potential and $\lambda$ is the energy cut-off to divergent loop integrals. With the observed Higgs boson mass at 125$GeV$, $\Lambda$ is estimated to be around 1$TeV$, and that is also roughly the limit to keep the naturalness of this observable. 
\\
\\However, many models beyond SM predicts the existence of particles at TeV scale, which means the naturalness could not be kept. For this reason, a correction for Brout-Englert-Higgs Mechanism is needed, or there is possibly a heavier Higgs boson to complete the theory.  
\\
\\{\bf Hierarchy Problem and Quantum Gravity}
\\
\\Hierarchy problem is defined in two ways: the unreasonable discrepancy between theoretical prediction and experimental result, or two comparable parameters. Higgs mass is one instance for the first definition. For the second one, it is generally referred to the gap between coupling strengths of weak interaction and gravity for the order of $10^{16}$.
\\
\\When a hierarchy problems occurs, the ``so-called'' fine-tuning is introduced to correct the discrepancy between two parameters. However, the fine-tinning could only be performed with enough understanding on the quantum effect of related parameters, and quantum gravity is still an unsolved problem. In the case, no solution is available.
\\
\\{\bf Neutrino Mass}
\\
\\Brout-Englert-Higgs Mechanism is the process to make particles massive within which the chirality of fermions would be changed. This implies that massive fermions of right-handed and left-handed chirality shall both exist, but no evidence is found for right handed neutrinos. Therefore, they are supposed be massless with SM. However, with the measurement of neutrino oscillation induced by the difference of neutrino mass and flavour eigenstates, they are practically massive particles. The conflict between SM and experiment still remains unsolved.
\section{Thesis Overview}
To solve the problems in SM, analyses are performed in two ways, resonance and non-resonance searches which are corresponding to two different signatures in physics: new particles or new couplings. The thesis will present how the experiment is set up to see the signatures of new physics in Chapter \ref{chap:exp}, and the following 4 chapters are dedicated to show the analyses of resonance and non-resonance searches with 2015+2016 data, and an additional chapter is for the ongoing work of the dataset collected from 2015 to 2018. The last chapter is for the simulation of the upgrade of LHC and ATLAS detector which will start to operate in 2021.
